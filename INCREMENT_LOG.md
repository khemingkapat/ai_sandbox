# Slinky Migration: Project Increment Log

This file tracks every discrete increment made during the Slinky migration. Its goal is to keep the human lead (**Khem**) fully informed of design choices, modified files, and verification steps.

## [Increment 1] - 2026-06-13: Kubernetes-Native Storage Isolation

*   **Author:** Antigravity (Interactive) & Khem
*   **Goal:** Replace complex LDAP/SSSD user directory synchronization with native Kubernetes Persistent Volume mounts mapped directly to host-level directories for isolation.

### 📝 Key Changes & Files Modified

1.  **Kind Cluster Configuration:**
    *   Updated [kind-config.yaml](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/kind-config.yaml): Configured all Kind cluster nodes (control-plane, worker 1, worker 2) to mount the local workspace path `/home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/storage` to `/mnt/storage` inside the cluster container.
2.  **Persistent Volume & Claim Definitions:**
    *   Created [pv-pvc.yaml](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/pv-pvc.yaml): Defined a ReadWriteMany PersistentVolume (`slinky-storage-pv`) targeting host path `/mnt/storage` and a corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim (`slinky-storage-pvc`) within the `slurm` namespace.
3.  **Helm Chart Customization:**
    *   Updated [values.yaml](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/values.yaml):
        *   Cleared out the complex and unused `sssd` configuration block (`sssd: {}`).
        *   Added volume mounts and volumes to the worker `nodesets`, making `slinky-storage-pvc` available at `/mnt/storage` inside the Slurm compute pods.
4.  **SSSD / LDAP Cleanup:**
    *   Deleted unused files (`Dockerfile`, `groups.ldif`, `sssd.conf`, `users.ldif`) that were previously used for LDAP integration.
5.  **Git Configuration & Storage Tracking:**
    *   Updated [.gitignore](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/.gitignore): Set up rules to keep [storage/projects/project1](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/storage/projects/project1) tracked as the core example, while ignoring all other dynamic projects (`project2`, `project3`), temporary checkpoints, python cache, and Kaggle cache files.
    *   Staged and committed the sample application files under [storage/projects/project1](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/storage/projects/project1).

### 💡 Why This Design?
*   **Simplicity:** Running a custom OpenLDAP server and configuring SSSD client daemons on every container is error-prone and adds high overhead. Native Kubernetes volumes handle file sharing and user directory separation much more reliably for local development.
*   **Local Dev Fidelity:** Mapping the host storage directory directly allows developers to inspect job output, logs, and workspace files directly from their local IDE without SSH or container-exec commands.

### 🛠️ Verification Steps
To spin up the cluster and verify this storage isolation setup:

1.  **Boot the cluster:**
    ```bash
    kup
    ```
    *(This creates the Kind cluster using [kind-config.yaml](file:///home/khemi/workspace/ai_sandbox/kind-config.yaml) and deploys Slinky with the storage mounts).*

2.  **Check PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim status:**
    ```bash
    kubectl get pv,pvc -n slurm
    ```
    *Ensure both `slinky-storage-pv` and `slinky-storage-pvc` show status `Bound`.*

3.  **Confirm the mount inside a compute pod:**
    ```bash
    kstat
    ```
    Find a running slurmd worker pod name, then run:
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -n slurm -it <pod-name> -c slurmd -- ls -la /mnt/storage
    ```
    *Confirm that the project folders (`project1`, etc.) are visible.*
